# FinderThePath
I'll tell you in advance that I'm not good at English and even more in progamming.

What the programm does:
1) There are two nodes, one is the start node and one is the aim node. You can move them whatever you want.
2) When you click on the empty cell you can make walls of your maze.
3) After your maze is ready press the 'S' button and see what happens.

In a future I want to add more Pathfinding algorithms, but for now I got only one(Dijkstra)


This code is not compleated, there are some nuances.
