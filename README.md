# FinderThePath
I'll tell you in advance that I'm not good at English.

What the programm does:
0) Finds the path from start node to aim node by using Dijkstra's algorithm.
1) There are two nodes, one is the start node and one is the aim node. You can move them whatever you want.
2) When you click on the empty cell you can make walls of your maze.
3) After your maze is ready press the 'S' button and see what happens.

In a future I want to add more Pathfinding algorithms.


This code is not compleated, there are some nuances.
